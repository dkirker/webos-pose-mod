Changes for 3.5 (2001-03-29)
----------------------------
*	Added m125, m130, m515, and i705 support.  NOTE: at the time of
	this writing, skins for these devices are not available.  There is
	no estimated date for when they will be available.

*	Enabled TRGpro and HandEra330 support for Mac. [Scott Gruby]

*	Allow access to the following UI data structures in support of
	PalmOSGlue that comes with SDK 4.0 Update 1 (DR1):

	read/write access to ControlType.attr for CtlGlueNewSliderControl
	and CtlGlueSetLeftAnchor

	read access to ListType.itemsText for LstGlueGetItemsText

	read access to TableType.numColumns for TblGlueGetColumnMasked

	read access to GraphicControlType.bitmapID and selectedBitmapID for
	CtlGlueGetGraphics

*	Re-allow read/write access to the text returned by CtlGetLabel,
	etc. It's OK to read the text, and we'll allow writing to the text
	until we come up with a better API for altering it. [many]

*	Fixed HostImportFileWithID to return a non-zero ID. [Scott Johnson]

*	Fixed timeout calculations when using redirected send/recieve
	calls. [many]

*	(Windows) Poser 3.4 de-asserted DTR when opening the host serial
	port.  Poser 3.5 reverts this change (DTR is asserted when the host
	serial port is opened). [many]

*	Fixed problem with inability to set/change socket address/port in
	serial port emulation redirection.  [Mahendra Tailor]

*	(Mac) Better Mac OS X support (Quit menu item now respects
	preferences regarding save-on-quit, and an idle Poser now gives more
	time to other running processes).  [Scott Gruby, Christopher Hunt]

*	(Unix) Fix the crawling dialogs (where dialogs appearing quickly in
	succession march down the screen).  [John Marshall]

*	When hostErrProfilingNotReady was added in Pose 3.1, it was done in
	such a way as to change the value of hostErrUnknownError.  Re-order
	those two symbols so that hostErrUnknownError retains its original
	value (at the expense of changing hostErrProfilingNotReady). [Scott
	Johnson]
