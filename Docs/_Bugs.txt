========================================================================

This document contains the list of known significant bugs in the Palm
OS Emulator.  This list is not complete -- many insignificant or
low-runner bugs have been omitted just to keep up the signal to noise
ratio.

*	Neil needs to receive cmdInitDatabase when his app is installed.

*	You can't reliably change the time with the Preferences App.  The
	time is generally synched with the host PC time.

*	It's not a good idea to load applications while the Launcher (the
	"Applications" application) is running.  If the program you're
	loading doesn't already exist, it won't show up in the list of
	installed application until you quit and restart Launcher.  If the
	application you're loading _does_ already exist, the Launcher won't
	refresh it's list, and will end up with a stale reference to the
	version you'd just replaced, leading to a Launcher crash.

*	We've seen one case where MacEmulator will draw the LCD area with a
	white background in single-scale mode instead of green.  The cause
	of this problem appears to be with an out-of-date driver for a video
	acceleration board.  Unless this is an issue for you, we probably
	won't try to figure out a workaround.

*	When working with an external debugger, make sure the ROM is awake
	(and not sleeping with a blank screen).  Otherwise, communication
	between the two applications will not occur.

*	Selecting Pilot, PalmPilot, Palm III, or Palm VII as the device to
	emulate always results in a PalmPilot being emulated.  There are
	very few side effects of this bug (for instance, a Pilot will now
	indicate that it has backlighting) but fixing this problem will
	probably cause more problems than it fixes (for instance, the Palm
	VII OS would then think that it's on Palm VII hardware instead of
	PalmPilot hardware and start trying to do Palm VII-specific things,
	and crashing because there is little actual support for Palm VII
	hardware).

*	When using NetLib redirection, NetLibSelect doesn't support the use
	of sysFileDescStdIn or sysFileDescStdOut.

*	There is no IR emulation.

*	HotSync doesn't work on Visor devices.

*	Many operations will hang the emulator if performed when the
	emulated power is off.  These operations include -- but are not
	limited to -- typing characters, clicking on the LCD area, running
	Gremlins, and installing files.  To be on the safe side, limit
	yourself to clicking on the hard buttons and closing/quitting the
	session.

*	Sound emulation doesn't work on the Mac.  The facilities previously
	used don't appear to be available under Carbon, and we haven't yet
	found any alternatives.  If you know about sound on the Mac, we
	could use your help!

*	The English Output created by the minimization process is very
	preliminary, rough, and incomplete.  Some things to know:

	* 	Pen down-drag-up event sequences are reported as a series of
		"Tap Pen" messages instead of "Press pen here, move to there,
		and finally lift up".

	* 	The English output will likely contain many messages to "Tap
		at x,y" instead of something more helpful like "Tap on button
		called 'Foo'".  That's because the code that determines what was
		tapped on is incomplete.  For instance, if the tap was on a menu
		item, you'll get the generic tap message.

	* 	In the cases where a tap at a specific location can't be
		related in terms for form objects or menu items, or where the
		exact location in the form object is critical (for instance, in
		the case of a scrollbar, where taps on the arrows are different
		from taps on the main part of the scrollbar but are still
		reported the same way), we hope to provide screen shots with
		cross-hairs at the location you should tap.

	To address these shortcomings, you may want to do one of two things:

	* 	Help the Palm OS Emulator effort by modifying Poser's output
		to be more accurate and expressive.  The schedule for the next
		release of Poser doesn't include time for Palm to address the
		issues in-house.

	* 	Replay the events from the <Original_File>_Min.pev file.  This
		effectively carries out the steps described in the English
		output.  The drawback with this approach is that replaying
		events also reloads the initial state that existed when the
		events were generated.  That is, you can't, say, start debugging
		your application under CodeWarrior, replay the events until an
		error occurs, and then break into the debugger.

	Enabling such a scenario may also be considered a third party
	opportunity.

*	Certain versions of Windows (NT 4.0 and '95 for sure, don't know
	about '98 or ME, but fixed in 2000 and XP) have a problem where they
	can truncate the bottom of the Choose File common dialog. The amount
	of this truncation (and even whether or not it occurs) is based on
	the size an location of the topmost window when the dialog is
	opened.  If you are seeing this truncation, try moving the
	underlying window or dialog up on the screen before opening the
	Choose File dialog.

*	Single-stepping in Gremlins when there is no specified upper event
	limit doesn't work.
